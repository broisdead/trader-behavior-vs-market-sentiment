Part C — Actionable Output
Objective

Based on the empirical findings from Parts A and B, this section proposes actionable strategy rules derived from observed relationships between market sentiment, trader behavior, and performance outcomes.

The goal is to translate analytical insights into practical trading adjustments.

Strategy Rule 1: Risk Reduction During Fear Regimes
Rule of Thumb

During Fear periods (Sentiment Index < 40):

Reduce average position size by 25–40%.

Avoid high-exposure trading behavior.

Prefer consistent (low-volatility) traders over aggressive traders.

Limit directional concentration (reduce strong long or short bias).

Rationale

Analysis shows that:

Average PnL declines during Fear regimes.

Win rate decreases.

PnL volatility (risk proxy) increases.

Drawdown risk is elevated.

Fear regimes are characterized by uncertainty and higher return dispersion.
Reducing leverage and exposure helps protect capital and stabilize performance.

Expected Outcome

Lower downside risk

Improved capital preservation

Reduced volatility in portfolio-level returns

Strategy Rule 2: Controlled Aggression During Greed Regimes
Rule of Thumb

During Greed periods (Sentiment Index > 60):

Allow moderately increased trade frequency.

Permit higher exposure for high-performing traders.

Maintain predefined stop-loss limits to control volatility.

Avoid excessive concentration in a single direction.

Rationale

Analysis indicates that:

Average PnL increases during Greed regimes.

Win rate improves.

Traders naturally increase position size and activity.

However, volatility also rises.

Greed periods offer stronger return potential but increased risk dispersion.
A structured increase in exposure, combined with risk controls, allows upside capture without uncontrolled risk.

Expected Outcome

Higher expected returns

Controlled volatility

Balanced participation in optimistic market conditions

Segment-Specific Adjustment (Optional Extension)
For High-Exposure Traders

Reduce position size during Fear.

Cap maximum trade size during Greed to prevent overconfidence bias.

For Frequent Traders

Maintain activity during Greed but introduce daily risk limits.

Reduce trade frequency during Fear to avoid noise-driven losses.

For Consistent Traders

Allocate higher capital weight during Fear regimes.

Maintain steady exposure across regimes.

Strategic Framework Summary
Sentiment Regime	Position Size	Trade Frequency	Risk Controls
Fear	Reduce	Reduce	Tight Stops
Neutral	Normal	Normal	Standard
Greed	Moderate Increase	Increase (Controlled)	Strict Caps
Conclusion

Market sentiment significantly influences trader performance and behavior.
Adapting trading intensity and exposure dynamically based on sentiment regimes improves risk-adjusted outcomes.

Rather than treating sentiment as descriptive information, it can be used as a risk management signal to adjust leverage, activity, and capital allocation.
